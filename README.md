# Arrow
Collaborative Study Tool

This iOS app allows students to share information for studying, ask classmates questions, and schedule study sessions.

The Xcode project consists of Arrox.xcodeproj, Arrow, and MVC. 
MVC (Model-View-Controller) contains the model classes, controller classes, and the main storyboard of the app.
The model connects the Kii Cloud SDK to the front end application.
The controller connects the model to the view.
And the storyboard creates the user interface.
The Arrow folder contains supplemental documents for the application.

Additionally, the Misc folder contains extra information about the data model, and graphics for the app.
